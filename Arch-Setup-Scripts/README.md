# Arch-Linux Post Installation Configuration

This script installs all the needed packages and puts the config files in their respective folders ```~/.config/<Program-name>```. It also creates and
configures a ```swapfile``` if the user requires it. 

**Note : Please answer the questions asked by the script carefully, any damage caused to your system is solely your responsibility!**

Since, that's out of the way now :smile: , you can run the script with the commands :

```
$ curl -fsSL https://tinyurl.com/4xxbyzjx > Arch_Setup
$ bash ./Arch_Setup
```

Run the Base Arch Installation Script with the commands :

```
$ curl -fsSL https://tinyurl.com/4kn79x78 > Arch_Install
$ bash ./Arch_Install
```
